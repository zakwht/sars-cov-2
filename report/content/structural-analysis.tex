    31 & Identified as a potential binding site of the spike protein. \\

    66 & Does not appear to be a binding site, mutation has no effect on the structure: rejected from model. \\
    83 & Identified as a potential binding site of the spike protein, mutation has no immediate effect on structure. \\
    113 & Affects bonds with serine at position 105. \\ 
    353 & Identified as a potential binding site of the spike protein, mutation affects bond with aspartate at position 38. \\
    426 & Identified as a potential binding site of the spike protein, mutation affects bonds with acids at positions 425 and 427. \\
    679 & Does not appear to be a binding site, mutation has no effect on the structure: rejected from model. \\
